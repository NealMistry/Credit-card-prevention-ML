Using Machine Learning to prevent credit card fraud,
Credit card fraud costs billions of dollars every year. As a result, there exists a pressing need to build effective credit card fraud detection systems. However, due to data security and privacy issues, banks and financial institutes are not permitted to share their transaction datasets. As a result, traditional models fail to learn the patterns of fraud or to detect them. This project aims to build a credit card fraud detection system using federated learning. Federated learning is envisioned to allow banks to process their transaction datasets in a decentralized way without the need to move the data into a centralized server.
